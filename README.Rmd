## Decisions vs defaults: a taxonomy of data science patterns

This repository contains the material for the Malaysian confeRence 21/22 November, 2020.

You can fork the Shiny app, _Exploring Time Series Features_ or [you can run it directly online](https://rexanalytics.shinyapps.io/taxonomy_forecast/).

Slides are `malaysian_confeRence_presentation.key` and the rest is just materials I used to put the talk together.

Feel free to reach out and thanks for having me (remotely) Malaysia!
